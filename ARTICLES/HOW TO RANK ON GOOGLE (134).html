<h1 class="post-title">WHAT IS SEO & HOW YOU CAN RANK ON GOOGLE?</h1>

<div class="article-body">

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering Stanford for grad school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was assigned to show him around. Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used backlinks to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search engine Backrub.</p>

<p>Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google. Google's mission was to find, organize and rank webpages based on relevancy. Over the next few years, Google caught the attention of not only the academic community but Silicon Valley investors as well. In August 1998, Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000, and Google Inc. was officially born.</p> 

<p>As the World Wide Web grew exponentially with the rise of Web 2.0, everyone wanted a piece of the pie. Soon the internet was overloaded with websites but there were only 10 spots on the first page of Google. Everyone wanted to be on that #1 spot of the SERPs.</p> 

<h2>WHAT IS SEO?</h2>

<p>Search engine optimization or SEO in short is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. The people who do SEO are also called SEOs (Search Engine Optimizers). SEO's purpose is to show search engines that your website is the most relevant resource for a given keyword by continuously improving it.</p> 

<p>SEO targets organic placements on Google which is one of the best sources of website traffic. People search with keywords on Google and when your product or service matches it, Google shows your website at the top. This makes traffic from search engines highly relevant and targeted.</p> 

<p>An SEO focuses on two aspects of your website - </p>
<ul>
<li>On-page factors (things that are present on your website)</li> 
<li>Off-page factors (things that are not present on your website)</li> 
</ul>

<h2>WHAT ARE GOOGLE RANKING FACTORS?</h2>

<p>According to Brian Dean, a famous SEO professional and blogger, <a target="_blank" href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors">there are more than 200 factors Google takes into consideration</a> when ranking websites for any given keyword. Among these, backlinks play a crucial role in the ranking according to most SEOs.</p>   

<p>Google uses a complex and gigantic algorithm to do this calculation in seconds. In fact, Google's search ranking algorithm is probably one of the largest and most advanced programs ever created in the history of mankind. No one can guess how exactly the algorithm ranks web pages.</p> 

<p>But don't think there is no hope of doing SEO anymore. Because from time to time, Google reveals some information regarding how its algorithm works and also published webmaster guidelines for people who want to see their website at the top of SERPs (search engine results pages).</p>

<p>Intelligent SEOs developed techniques and methodologies to rank websites at #1 positions which worked over and over again. It's not something that anyone can do. People develop certain skills by trying to rank different keywords in years of trial and error. Ranking an informational keyword is different from ranking a product, ranking a local business website is different from ranking an international manufacturer. Every keyword and every website is different and needs close examination and analysis by a professional SEO.</p>

<h2>HOW TO CREATE CONTENT THAT RANKS?</h2>

<p>We all know, content is the king. There is no point applying all the SEO tactics of the world if Google can't find the desired content users are looking for on your website. You need to understand user intent first and publish the content accordingly. You need to think of yourself as your ideal visitor and ask what kind of answer to your search query you're looking for.</p> 

<p>Are your users looking for long explanations? You need to create content with detailed information packed with images and charts and other relevant pieces. If your users are looking for short, fast, and simple answers, then don't annoy them with five thousand-word essays. Google perfectly understands user intent because they gather data on all types of keywords. If your content doesn't meet the criteria they are looking for, it will never rank well no matter how good you think your content is. </p>        

<h2>THE POWER OF BACKLINKS</h2>

<p>Creating content by perfectly fulfilling user intent is the first step toward ruling the search engines. But it's not the only factor. You created content, Google thinks it's great. But they don't rank your website based on their own liking only. They need to know that other people like your content as well. And how exactly do they find out if other people on the internet like your content or not? They look at your backlinks, links coming from other websites to your webpage. If you just created the content and no one has found out about it yet, how come they will link to it? People don't even know you created something, let alone linked to it.</p>

<p>This is where link building comes into play. Instead of waiting for other people to find your content and link to it, which may take months or even years, we do it ourselves. We promote our content on other websites and send it to other webmasters so that they can take a look at it. And if they like what they see, we respectfully ask them to link to it from their own websites.  </p> 

<p>These links from high authority and relevant websites count as votes and Google takes those as recommendations. As a result, your website rises high on SERPs and everyone who searches for it can find it right away. </p>

<h2>WHERE TO GET HIGH AUTHORITY BACKLINKS?</h2>

<p>Backlinks from other websites in the same niche can be the best kind of backlinks. You may also need backlinks from the most popular websites on the world wide web to increase the trust and authority of your website. This can be done by contacting other webmasters and asking for backlinks. Some webmasters link to your website if they like the content and think your website is relevant to their audience. Other webmasters may take a fee to link to you. </p>

<p>SEO Link building can be a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Professional SEOs and link builders already established connections with large groups of webmasters and created huge lists of link-building resources. They can build backlinks to your website in a cost-effective and time-efficient way. In often cases, it is more productive to take service from a professional SEO link builder instead of trying to do it yourself and destroy your website in the process.</p>

<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

<p>I, as a professional SEO link builder, have helped hundreds of website owners ranging from e-commerce shop websites to niche bloggers and local service providers to commercial websites, reach their audience and customers through Google organic search rankings. I started as a blogger in 2013 and ended up being an SEO because I take ranking each keyword as a game and really enjoy doing it. From 2022, I decided to provide my services through Fiverr.</p> 

<p>If you're having a hard time getting good traffic from Google, just talk to me, and let's try one more time. I will do my best for the foremost possible outcome.</p>
